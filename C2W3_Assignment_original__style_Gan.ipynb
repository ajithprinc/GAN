The truncation trick resamples the noise vector $z$ from a truncated normal distribution which allows you to tune the generator's fidelity/diversity. The truncation value is at least 0, where 1 means there is little truncation (high diversity) and 0 means the distribution is all truncated except for the mean (high quality/fidelity). This trick is not exclusive to StyleGAN. In fact, you may recall playing with it in an earlier GAN notebook."

By mixing an upsampled 8 x 8 image (which is 16 x 16) with increasingly more of the 16 x 16 generator output, the generator is more stable as it progressively trains.

The key here is that the $\\alpha$ term is gradually increased until eventually, only the image from (1), the generator, is used.
